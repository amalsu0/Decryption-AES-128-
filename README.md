## AES-128

 Part1:
    Writing a program that uses AES-128 to decrypt a message using the ciphertext (ciphertext.dat) and secret key (key.dat) for testing.
    
 Part2:
   Using "brute force" to decrypt an encrypted message, where only having the first 96-bits of the 128-bit secret key (last 4 bytes of the secret
   key are missing!) and the original message starts with the word "Salam". 
   Using the ciphertext (ciphertext2.dat) and partial key (partial-key.dat) for testing.
